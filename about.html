      <div class="section">I am an undergraduate student at <strong>Seoul National University</strong>, College of Liberal Studies. I am
        currently working towards Bachelor's degrees on <strong>Computer Science and Engineering, Psychology,</strong> and
        <strong>Information Science & Culture</strong>. (I know, I have three majors. No, I wasn't purposefully aiming for HCI)
      </div>
      <div class="section">My current interests include human-computer interaction, accessible interfaces, interactive narratives and game development, graphic/motion design, among other things. 
        As of now, my goal is to build a strong enough foundation to (hopefully) begin research in <strong>human-computer interaction</strong></div>
