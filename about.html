        Hi. I'm Haesoo, and welcome to my website :) </br></br>
        I am an undergraduate student at <strong>Seoul National University</strong>, College of Liberal Studies. I am
        currently working towards degrees on <strong>Computer Science and Engineering, Psychology,</strong> and
        <strong>Information Science & Culture</strong>. My current interests include Accessible Design, Machine
        Learning, Media Art, Data Visualization, Game Development, Graphic/Motion Design and more. As of now, my goal is
        to build a strong enough foundation to (hopefully) begin research in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction
          Design</strong>, among other things.
