      <p class="col1">I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, College of Liberal Studies. Currently working for a degree on Computer Science and Engineering, Psychology, and Information Science & Culture. My current interests include Media Art, Data Visualization, Game Development, Graphic Design, Animation, Accessible Design and more. As of now, my goal is to build a strong enough foundation to (hopefully) begin research in <strong>Human-Computer Interactions</strong>, among other things.</p>
      <div class="col2">
        <p>I am deeply dedicated to learning the relationship between technology, arts and humanity, how they come together to create experiences and memories unique to each individual, and how they can influence lives to change for the better.</p>

        <p>I am also a firm believer in equal rights for everyone (in a general sense), especially in technology. Thus, I strive to discover how technology can help implement equality, and also how accessible technology might develop so that it ensures no one is isolated in the fast-developing world that is today. </p>
