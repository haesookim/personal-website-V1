    <p>One of my interests and more recent pasttimes include Drawings and Illustration, mainly Pixel Art.</p>
    <p>Here's to showcasing what I'd done since I've started.</p>
  </div>

  <!--implement a 'search'/'menu' function using tags on the art: use visible() and hide() methods by css?-->
  <!--add art with captions and tags, layout in gallery format-->
  <!--clicking on item will summon a close up tooltip window where you can arrow key through the rest of the art-->
</div>
